# Vanilla JavaScript To-Do App (Front-end only)

## What this is
A simple, front-end only To-Do list application built with plain (vanilla) JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
Features:
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks complete (toggle)
- Delete tasks
- Clear all completed tasks
- Instant UI updates (no page reload)
- Persists tasks in `localStorage` so tasks survive page reloads (optional)

## Files
- `index.html` — the markup
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — app logic (DOM manipulation, event handling)
- `README.md` — this file

## How to run (two easy ways)
### Option A — VS Code + Live Server (recommended)
1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Install the **Live Server** extension if you don't have it.
3. Right-click `index.html` and choose **Open with Live Server**.
4. The app opens in your browser. Add, complete, and delete tasks.

### Option B — Chrome + local file
1. Open `index.html` in Chrome (double-click). The app works, but `localStorage` still functions.
2. For best development experience prefer Live Server.
